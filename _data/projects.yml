-   title: In-Hand Manipulation using Soft Hands
    year: 2019-Present
    img:  hand_muffin_small.jpg
    description: The last few years, I have been working to understand how to design soft robotics hands with enough dexterity to perform in-hand manipulation.  I am looking at all aspects of hand design including finger design (and relevant workspace), finger arrangement, and palm design.

-   title: 'Ctrl-P: Smooth Pneumatic Pressure Control for Soft Robots'
    year: 2018-Present
    img:  pressure_controller.jpg
    description: Smooth pressure control is a useful and straightforward way to control soft robotic fingers. I built a custom pneumatic control system for my research, including microcontroller firmware for realtime pressure control, a python-based control interface, and ROS drivers for integration with other robotic subsystems.
