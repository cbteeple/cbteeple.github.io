-   title: Industrial-Grade 3D Camera Product
    year: 2022-2024
    img:  rhr_camera.png
    description: Lead the development of a high-performance, industrial-grade 3D camera 
        product as part of the RightPick 4 piece-picking system, and successfully brought 
        it to market. As the Tech Lead for this project, I lead a cross-functional team 
        of subject-matter experts, and coordinated the hardware design and software 
        architecture to ensure seamless integration with the rest of the RightPick 4 system. 
        As an individual contributor, I owned both the hardware design and industrial design 
        of the camera system, and developed several core software features enabling its operation.

-   title: "Armstron: Use a robot arm for materials testing"
    year: 2022-Present
    img:  armstron_logo.png
    description: This ROS package and associated GUI make use of the 6-axis force/torque sensor on the Universal Robot e-series arms to apply complex loads to materials. We can essentially perform tests similar to an Instron Uniaxial Testing machine, but in all six axes.

-   title: 'Ctrl-P: Smooth Pneumatic Pressure Control for Soft Robots'
    year: 2018-Present
    img:  pressure_controller_v3-0.jpg
    description: Smooth pressure control is a useful and straightforward way to control soft robotic fingers. I built a custom pneumatic control system for my research, including microcontroller firmware for realtime pressure control, a python-based control interface, and ROS drivers for integration with other robotic subsystems.<br><br>I have now built four systems, all of which are actively used by lab members on a daily basis. Additionally, systems can be easily chained together for applications requiring more than 10 channels.
